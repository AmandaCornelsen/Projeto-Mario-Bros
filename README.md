## Overview
Mario Bros  is a simple, interactive web project built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It’s designed as a playful way to practice and demonstrate your front-end development skills: responsive design, user interaction, and creative visual styling.

## ​ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** — provides the game’s structure.
- **CSS3** — brings styling, layout, and responsive adjustments.
- **JavaScript** — handles game logic, movement, and interactivity.

## Features
- **Responsive layout**: adapts to different screen sizes for a consistent user experience.
- **Character animation**: basic movement of a character styled like Mario.
- **User interaction**: movement via keyboard controls (e.g., arrow keys or WASD).
- **Modular file structure**: organized HTML, CSS, and JS files within a `src/` directory.
